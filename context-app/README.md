# React Context & Hooks

## Two branches, one containing react `Context API` and the other `Hooks` usage

### `Context` API

A basic relation between component and state sharing using `Consumer` and `Provider` method in `Class Components`


### `Hooks`

Uses of different hooks like `useState`,`useEffect`,`useContext` to hook into the the state and components. Class components were converted into `Functional Components`
